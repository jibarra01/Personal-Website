    <h2 style="font-family: 'Jellee Roman';">Hello, I'm Jocelyn Ibarra</h2>
  <p>I'm a senior at the University of New Mexico, a graphic designer, and a small business owner. I'm happy you have stumbled upon my page, and I hope you enjoy everything there is to experience. On this website, you can read a little bit about who I am, my educational background, a walk-through of my portfolio, and how to keep in contact with me. 
As a small business owner, I enjoy showing my creations and hope you also enjoy them. I've been a small business owner for 4 years, and every year, I've been able to expand my network and opportunities. A lot of my work focuses on South Korean pop music, and it's something that I've been able to enjoy for the past 7 years. I've been studying art studio for 3 years now, and through these experiences, I've learned a lot about my art and what I can create through digital art.
Throughout this blog, you will see my business's branding, and I hope you enjoy your time on my blog. Feel free to check out my business and work!</p>
